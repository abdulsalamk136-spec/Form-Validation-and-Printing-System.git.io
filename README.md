# Form-Validation-and-Printing-System.git.io
This project is a web-based application designed to streamline the candidate registration process using a modern, client-side technology stack. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the system provides a robust and interactive user experience for collecting and managing applicant information.
Core functionality:
Dynamic form processing: The system features a recruitment-style form that captures various candidate details and dynamically populates a structured data table upon submission.
Client-side form validation: Comprehensive, real-time validation logic ensures data integrity and a positive user experience. This prevents common input errors by providing immediate feedback on invalid fields.
On-demand record generation: The application can generate a formatted, printable document—such as an entrance slip or ID card—for the most recently added candidate. This feature leverages JavaScript to render a customized view of the user's data and image, which can be sent directly to a printer.
Interactive data management: Applicant data is displayed in a clear, accessible table format on the same page, allowing for instant review of new entries.
